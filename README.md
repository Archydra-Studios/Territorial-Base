### What is Territorial?
Territorial is a minecraft Fabric Mod that takes a more lenient approach to protecting your stuff...

Infact gone are the days of feeling safe at all, territorial adds traps, player bounties, lockpicks and bombs to really spice up your gameplay and allow others to invade and take your stuff, imagine factions but more brutal.
